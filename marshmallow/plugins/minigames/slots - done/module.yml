    description:
      Spin the slot machine, maybe you win, maybe you don't.
      Who knows? It costs 10 Kud to spin the slot machine by default.
      But you can specify how much you want to put in the machine.
      And the rewards are based on how many of the same icon you get
      in the middle row. Rewards are different for each icon.
      The slots can be spun only once every 60 seconds.
